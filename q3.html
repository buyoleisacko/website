            <p>The Negative Impacts 1: Too many conservative societies, Western marketing comes off as compromising the moral principles or values that guide youth behavior, especially with such products as music, video games, and film. <br> Some countries collectively subscribe to cultural and/or religious beliefs that they hold in high esteem. <br>Marketing messages and activities influence society as a whole, and it is crucial that the eventual relationship between buyer and seller remains ethical. <br> Most countries believe in sustaining their belief system, and because the youth are the most vulnerable to foreign influence, business decisions should place greater recognition of ethical considerations. <br> 2: Guardianship: There is some lack of guardianship in western culture from my point of view. As it may western parents think that their children attain enough caliber to take their own life decisions or it may be children’s ignorance to their parent’s role on their life decision. <br> But better guidance is very important in someone’s better future. And sometimes this lack of guardianship cause teens to be trapped in a condition of depression and anxiety.
